# Sample JWT authentication structure

Hello all,
This REST API is a simple way of handling authentication using JWT tokens. Keep reading for more details ðŸ‘‡. Cheers!

## To get this project up and running

    git clone https://github.com/emilsharier/jwt-auth
    npm install

__NOTE__! If you're running the project in dev mode, make sure you create a .env file which would consist of the following

    SECRET=<Some secret private key>
    DATABASE_URL=<Database URL>

### Dev mode

    npm run dev

### Release

    npm start

## npm modules I used

    express (To handle all HTTP requets and responses)
    jsonwebtoken (Middleware to validate and verify JWT tokens)
    bcrypt (For enrypting and hashing the password using a private key)
    morgan (Logging middleware)
    sequelize (An ORM so that you can implement the database of your choice)
    pg (In my case I decided to use PostgreSQL)
